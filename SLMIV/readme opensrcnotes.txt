IMPORTANT NOTES ABOUT SL My Inventory Viewer OPEN SOURCE
3rd party Tools Used
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
SL My Inventory uses the 3rd party library Wintellect Power Collections

Due to its license I can not include PowerCollections.dll unless I 
include the entire open source of Power Collections.  Therefore, I
am not including PowerCollections.dll included with any project.zip 
files.  I will provide it in a zip file in the downloads area by itself.
The full source code for PowerCollections maybe found here:
http://www.wintellect.com/PowerCollections.aspx

and maybe downloaded at:
