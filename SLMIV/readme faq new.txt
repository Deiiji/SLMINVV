Q: Why do I freeze-up when using the SL Connection feature?
A: 1) After a 'Connected' status, SLMIV starts creating your inventory
as SLMIV objects and this may take a few minutes.
You will be forwarded to the 'My Inventory' tab when SLMIV obtains your inworld inventory.
2) Any SL errors will be displayed and also found in the SL ConnectLog;
Examine 'slconnectlog.txt' found in the installation folder for troubleshooting.
3) Please check the SL Grid Status. In most cases, it is the SL server gremlins.
